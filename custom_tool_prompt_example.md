TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

# Tools

## read_file

Description: Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path. Use this when you need to examine the contents of an existing file you do not know the contents of, for example to analyze code, review text files, or extract information from configuration files. The output includes line numbers prefixed to each line (e.g. "1 | const x = 1"), making it easier to reference specific lines when creating diffs or discussing code. By specifying start_line and end_line parameters, you can efficiently read specific portions of large files without loading the entire file into memory. Automatically extracts raw text from PDF and DOCX files. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as it returns the raw content as a string.
Parameters:

- path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current workspace directory {{workspace}})
- start_line: (optional) The starting line number to read from (1-based). If not provided, it starts from the beginning of the file.
- end_line: (optional) The ending line number to read to (1-based, inclusive). If not provided, it reads to the end of the file.
  Usage:
  <read_file>
  <path>File path here</path>
  <start_line>Starting line number (optional)</start_line>
  <end_line>Ending line number (optional)</end_line>
  </read_file>

## write_to_file

Description: Request to write content to a file. This tool is primarily used for **creating new files** or for scenarios where a **complete rewrite of an existing file is intentionally required**. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
Parameters:

- path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current workspace directory {{workspace}})
- content: (required) The content to write to the file. When performing a full rewrite of an existing file or creating a new one, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Do NOT include the line numbers in the content though, just the actual content of the file.
- line_count: (required) The number of lines in the file. Make sure to compute this based on the actual content of the file, not the number of lines in the content you're providing.
  Usage:
  <write_to_file>
  <path>File path here</path>
  <content>
  Your file content here

## apply_diff

Description: Request to apply targeted modifications to an existing file by searching for specific sections of content and replacing them. This tool is ideal for precise, surgical edits when you know the exact content to change. It helps maintain proper indentation and formatting.
You can perform multiple distinct search and replace operations within a single `apply_diff` call by providing multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the `diff` parameter. This is the preferred way to make several targeted changes to one file efficiently.
The SEARCH section must exactly match existing content including whitespace and indentation.
If you're not confident in the exact content to search for, use the read_file tool first to get the exact content.
When applying the diffs, be extra careful to remember to change any closing brackets or other syntax that may be affected by the diff farther down in the file.
ALWAYS make as many changes in a single 'apply_diff' request as possible using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks

Parameters:

- path: (required) The path of the file to modify (relative to the current workspace directory {{workspace}})
- diff: (required) The search/replace block defining the changes.

Diff format:

```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: (required) The line number of original content where the search block starts.
-------
[exact content to find including whitespace]
=======
[new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

```

Usage:
<apply_diff>
<path>File path here</path>
<diff>
Your search/replace content here
You can use multi search/replace block in one diff block, but make sure to include the line numbers for each block.
Only use a single line of '=======' between search and replacement content, because multiple '=======' will corrupt the file.
</diff>
</apply_diff>
